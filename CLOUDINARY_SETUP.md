- ✅ `server/routes/events.js` - Events now upload to Cloudinary

## 🚀 Setup Cloudinary (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Free Cloudinary Account

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free
2. Sign up with email or Google
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After login, you'll see your **Dashboard**:

```
Cloud Name:    your-cloud-name
API Key:       123456789012345
API Secret:    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

Copy these 3 values!

### Step 3: Update Your `.env` File

Open: `server/.env`

Replace these lines:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

With your actual credentials:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=my-alumni-network
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Server

```powershell
cd server
nodemon server.js
```

### Step 5: Test Upload

1. Login to your Alumni Network
2. Create a new post with an image
3. Check Cloudinary Dashboard → Media Library
4. You should see your uploaded image!

```

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### Check 1: Server Logs
When you upload, you should see:
```
POST /posts - Image uploaded to Cloudinary
```

### Check 2: Database
Image URLs will look like:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud-name/image/upload/v1234567890/alumni-network/abc123.jpg
```

Instead of:
```
/uploads/1234567890-image.jpg
```

### Check 3: Cloudinary Dashboard
- Login to Cloudinary
- Go to **Media Library**
- See folder: `alumni-network`
- All your uploaded images are there!

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cloudinary configuration missing"

**Solution:**
Check your `.env` file has all 3 credentials:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
```

Restart server after updating `.env`

### Problem: Upload fails with 401 error

**Solution:**
- Check API credentials are correct
- Copy them again from Cloudinary Dashboard
- Make sure no extra spaces in `.env` file

### Problem: Old images not showing

**Don't worry!** This is normal because:
- Old images still in local `uploads/` folder
- New images go to Cloudinary
- Both will work fine

**To migrate old images to Cloudinary** (optional):
I can create a migration script for you if needed.

## 📱 Image Limits & Optimization

### Current Settings:
- **Max file size**: 5 MB
- **Allowed formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
- **Auto-optimization**: Images resized to max 1000x1000px
- **Folder**: All images saved in `alumni-network/` folder

### To Change Settings:

Edit `server/config/cloudinary.js`:

```javascript
params: {
  folder: 'alumni-network',
  allowed_formats: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp'],
  transformation: [
    { width: 2000, height: 2000, crop: 'limit' } // Increase size
  ]
}
```
